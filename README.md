# The Pride Project
 
 Every summer, most Major League Baseball teams celebrate LGBTQ Pride with a special commemorative game. This project will attempt to identify the teams that are the most effective in promoting inclusiveness and diversity amongst their fan bases, and to idenfity the fan bases that most support diversity.  
 
 This project is in the initial phases but is expected to incorporate on the following:
 
   * Python and Pandas for data cleaning
   * Twitter API and ScraPy to collect tweets
   * Scikit-learn, Vader, and NLTK for sentiment analysis and natural language processing
   * Tableau, Flourish and WordCloud for visualizations
