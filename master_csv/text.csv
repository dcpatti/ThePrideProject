5,"# Angels  social media representative LITERALLY said ""proud"" ""supporting  LGBTQ  youth.""

This sexualizes children and attempts to normalize deviancy.

A baseball team has no business advancing social behavior propaganda, and should fire their offensively leftist politics pushers."
6,"Noticed the @Nationals  didn't mention "" LGBTQ  youth"" in their #SpiritDay  tweet, so I took a look around @MLB . * indicates purple avatar.

7,"To quote @larrywilmore , ""saying the word gay doesn't make you gay, it's not like Beetlejuice."" I'm dismayed that my two favorite teams (Nats & BoSox) basically danced around the fact that #SpiritDay  is SPECIFICALLY to support  LGBTQ + youths."
8,"The Red Sox are what I'd call tier 1A. They QTd the MLB tweet (which explicitly stated "" LGBTQ  youth"") and linked to their #SpiritDay  partnership with @FenwayHealth . That's a lot more than most of the teams in the league. (And then there's the Astros.) https:// twitter.com/RedSox/status/ 1053005809066463232   …"
9,Huh?   LGBTQ  youth? Where are the parents?  Where are your bibles?  What does LQBTQ have to do with supporting bullying?  Please read what the bible says about supporting people that live in sin.  Living in sexual immorality is not good.  In God We Trust
10,"This is exactly why  LGBTQ  has to do with bullying.
People like you think you can dictate to others how to live because it says so in your book. You think you can push your beliefs on others because you feel superior to them.  That is what bullying is."
11,Everyone has their own beliefs. He doesn't support it. Also  LGBTQ  pushes their agendas on everyone else. I don't see you saying anything about them. I really don't care what people do with their lives but when they try to interject their beliefs into my life it becomes BS
12,LGBTQ  is fighting for equal rights. Not bullying others based on personal religious beliefs.
13,God gives all of us life and will judge us in death.  He gives all of us free will so each of us can make our own choices.  Some choose to ignore and bully all others with an  LGBTQ  agenda. America is equal.  The greedy groups want more and more. In God We Trust
14,Please stop cyber bullying me.  You are showing the world with your 10 replies who the real bully is and why  LGBTQ  agenda wants to bully all of us into giving  LGBTQ  more.  Equality is equality... not more.  I do not expect the Angels to have Christian night.  In God We Trust

1747,"First of all, I wasn’t responding to you, so I wasn’t missing your point. Second, is  Pride   Night  going to affect your ability to listen to the game? Does it affect you in any way, shape or form?"

Now, you could ask about a ""Straight""  night , but the thing is:  Pride  is about everyone, including straight people (though we really don't have much reason to celebrate it)."
1758,Leave that sensible data driven shit to the national media. When I listen to my local stations I want to hear positive feedback and optimism and total unequivocal  Cardinals   pride .

2315,Close enough. Values Voters Summit. If you know anything about Tony Perkins he’s synonymous with anti  LGBTQ  hate groups couched under religiosity.
2316,Just because people believe marriage is between a man & woman doesn't mean they are anti  lgbtq . Or that they hate anybody.
2317,How about a change of heart for  LGBTQ  and support for sensible gun laws?
2318,"Good for you, Mr. Anti- LGBTQ ."
2319,That was a good pitch.  Now be nice to the  LGBTQ  community
2320,"Great, now go pitch anti  LGBTQ  bullshit A/H"
2321,How about throwing a pitch for the #LGBTQ  Community. It's way more important than throwing a pitch at a game of baseball on your birthday.
2322,And you're speaking at an anti- LGBTQ  forum after life being saved by gay woman!!
2323,"Critically injured by deranged man w/assault rifle.  Saved by lesbian police officer.
Comes back pro-gun, anti  LGBTQ ."
2324,"Glad you've recovered, but your views on gun control and  LGBTQ  issues stink!"

2326,Hypocritical bigot! Have you no sense of shame? #LGBTQ
2327,Glad you had that birthday.  Wish you respected the  LGBTQ  community that afforded you your life.
2328,He's speaking at an event that undeniably anti  LGBTQ
2329,Thanks to one of the people who did her job when she saved your sorry ass! How dare you decide to speak at an anti  LGBTQ  rally ??!! 
2330,Because hating  LGBTQ  people and trying to stop them acquiring equal rights... is bigotry?

4838,So before anything happens in this #Mets  #Braves  ga e which is knotted at 0 after 5 I just want to say. This absolutely feels like one of those games the #Mets  just lose. DeGrom doing great against division leader in big game but team can't get it done. Prove me wrong #Mets
4839,This game screams #Mets  loss in the most #Metsian  way possible. DeGrom dominate. No run support  Mets  lose 3-1 type of way. Wouldn't be surprised if Albies or Freeman got a hold of one here in the 8th to put them ahead the way the #Braves  have been playing lately
4840,What are the odds Ex #mets  Adieny Hech ends up sparking a winning rally in the 9th for the #Braves  ?
4841,Say one thing about tonight bullpen has been on target for both teams. But the #Mets  are getting into their dregs. The #Braves  can take advantage here. Bullpen depth #Mets  biggest weakness. And gets exposed in long extra innings games. Worse yet Lugo prob unavailable tomorrow
4842,"I'm not  gay  but would really love to see some @Mets  titty right now...
#LFGM  #LGM"
4843,Oh boy if #mets  lose this game they will have no one to blame but themselves. You have to shorten up your swings and out a ball in play there. Long Swings by Alonso and Conforto soon that inning.
4844,Just waiting for the inevitable HR the #mets  seem to give up to away teams in Xtra Inning games
4845,Boy right now the #Braves  just own the #mets  they are the one team the #Mets  just can't seem to solve on any consistent basis. There is a reason Atlanta is leading the NL East and we are seeing it tonight with there injury depleted team gutting one out

6419,@ TheGhostofMarv  Not sure if you would know but are the Rockies the only  MLB  team without a  pride  night. I just ask this because I know you’ve talked about it in the past and I noticed at a minor league game in rural Montana that they are hosting a  pride  night soon.
6420,The fact that #MLB  managers are able to yell/bitch/moan and groan to umpires and get praised when they get tossed early in games by their players is absolutely ridiculous and shameful. The players need you in the dugout. Swallow your  pride  and manage the gods damned game.

7520,Firing John Mallee is the scapegoat for people who are  gay  for Gabe Kapler.

8907,"So you calling god “ gay ” is kinda in the wrong for u. I know u don’t believe in god and I ain’t gonna force u to believe in what I believe but I’m just gonna say this......              Adam is a man and Eve is a women so therefore, Almighty god is not a  gay ."

8910,Guess losing is the only thing the Red Sox aren’t in  pride  with 
8911,And I’m telling you that shit didn’t happen. The Bible is fiction and I’m calling god  gay  because it’s funny. Adam was a man and Steve was a man. That’s a better story to me
8912,"And I mean that as a compliment.  Gay  people have way more fun. If your god is real, why wouldn’t he want to be  gay ? 
I’ll stop calling god  gay  as soon as you acknowledge there’s nothing wrong with being  gay"

9049,The last time the Reds used the word  pride  in a tweet was October.
9050,"Hey, @reds  take some  pride  in your  Pride  events and let everyone know about them."
9051,"Pride  Community Night is absolutely a Reds promotion that they are absolutely not mentioning. If you check the promotional calendar, it's there."
9052,"Hey @Reds , any particular reason you're refusing to promote your  Pride   Night  on the 1st, or can't even bother to list it on the schedule? #DoBetter"
9053,@ Reds  watching the game vs the Cubs and see advertising for other special/themed games but I’ve seen nothing for the  Pride  Game. ALL fans should be FULLY & EQUALLY represented. You’ve dropped the ball on this Reds front office!  pic.twitter.com/b1N9hAf1Fm
9054,"Pathetic tweet. Fans want to celebrate legendary players & have a good  night . Let  reds  laugh if they want, they’re tools with their own trophyless ‘boss’ nights -u don’t mention that. Ppl like u are tedious joyless no-marks with no sense of  pride  in the club u pretend to support.  https:// twitter.com/RoperCarl/stat us/1132911700959797248   …"

9059,CANT WAIT FOR THE  PRIDE   NIGHT  THAT YOUR OBVIOUSLY NOT PRETENDING DOESNT EXIST
9060,"Tomorrow (June 1) is LGBT  Pride  Community  Night  at Great American Ball Park. Anyone seen a  Reds  TV commercial or social media spot promoting this? 

Wonder if  Reds  social media employees will be allowed to Tweet about it tomorrow  night  as it's taking place."
9061,Reds  didn't promote  Pride   night .  The  Reds  didn't promote Jewish community  night  either
9062,"Here's press release  Reds  issued May 26 detailing highlights of home stand. Even a section on ""Ticket Offers for this Homestand"" but crickets on LGBT  Pride   Night  (June 1) and related, you know, ticket offer. 

The  Reds  must be really, really proud.

9063,"Hey @Reds  social media folks, are you allowed to tweet about  Pride  Community  Night  this year?"
9064,"Hey @Reds , are you allowed to promote tomorrow's  Pride   night  yet? You're certainly happy enough to make money on the ticket package..."
9065,"So the  Reds  won’t formally promote  Pride   Night , but they’ll admit their transgendered pitcher broke his coot-coot?! "
9066,"Ahem... @Reds  who have not publicly announced it’s  Pride   Night  tomorrow. We are in the same damn country, FFS.  https:// twitter.com/Dodgers/status /1134602976008450048   …"

9069,hey @Reds  you gonna tweet about  Pride   Night  this year?
9070,Happy  pride  month to everyone except the @Reds  who won’t promote their  pride   night  on social media
9071,"Opposite of  pride  is shame. @Reds  not promoting LGBT  Pride   Night  is the opposite of being prideful. 

@Reds , do you know what the word  PRIDE  entails?  https:// twitter.com/kouragekundahl /status/1134877864283631616   …"
9072,"Today is  Pride  Community  Night  in Cincinnati for the #Reds  game. There will be a pregame ceremony honoring the LGBTQ Community Advocate Award Winner. 

It will be interesting to see how the  Reds  handle that on radio, TV, and social."
9073,"Well, we know that the  Reds  haven't handled past  Pride  nights the same way that some other teams have. 

We also know that a few teams don't even have a  Pride   night , too."
9074,Better question: are they going to give me a 2018  Pride  hat?
9075,"I’ve given up hope. The new  Pride  hats look terrible, and even if they do sell them in the team shop, which they won’t, I wouldn’t want one. The 2018 design is amazing and perfect."
9076,"The  Reds  certainly promoted the ""A  Night  of Their Own"" for women a lot differently than they've promoted  Pride   Night  (which they literally haven't).

So, yes. They have handled it a little bit differently."
9077,"We also know that the  Reds  handle their  Pride   Night  promotion a bit differently than some other teams are handling theirs (like actually talking about it). The  Reds  didn't mention it at all last year. 

We're hoping for better this year."
9078,But it's also worth noting that a few MLB teams don't have  Pride   Night 's at all. The  Reds  are at the very least doing better than those teams are.
9079,You are trying very hard here to downplay the point that the  Reds  didn't mention  Pride   Night  existing.....
9080,glad to see the @Reds  are celebrating  Pride   Night  by having a pedophile throw out the first pitch  pic.twitter.com/GD9HapQyhA
9081,I'll celebrate Lesbian-Gay-Bisexual-Transgender-Queer  Pride   Night  once the  Reds  have a Pro-Choice Abortion Rights Celebration  night  as well. Until they show they are for Women's Rights they are still supporting the oppressive patriarchy! This is not enough!

Has the  Reds  broadcast said anything about it today? "
9090,".@Reds  social media nor TV broadcast never promoted  LGBTQ  night at the stadium today. Embarrassing. The @Dodgers  did, but Cincinnati chose not to. #MLB"
9091,"With the @Reds  celebrating  Pride  Community  Night  today, #QueerFancyStats  pledges were quadrupled! Sean came in to pitch the bottom of the 9th with the Nats up 5-2 and gmLI 0.92. With a 1-2-3 inning, that's a #CurlyW  in the books, & June's #PrideMonth  donation starts off at $7.68!"
9092,I sadly witnessed an AWFUL man harass a group of @Reds  fans who were wearing their  pride  hats at today’s game. It made me lose a lot of faith in humanity.
9093,"Two weeks until our first Living With Change gala and as I’ve been chatting w/ you all I know of all the conflicts:  Pride  month, Columbus  Pride , St. Elizabeth  Reds   Night , Cincinnati  Pride   Night  at the Zoo, & the price itself but I would one, love to see y’all at this great  night ."
9094,So why is it that on the  night  of  pride   night  for the Loucity game. The @LouisvilleBats  of the decided to rub chicken fillet in everyone face. By putting up not one but two big signs. So it's clear that the @Reds  organization has a problem with gay people and the @FairnessCamp .

9099,"@ reds  the @wv_power  even have the guts to advertise and promote their  pride   night . As in, they are located, in West by God Virginia. Step up your game please."

9666,Okay so @tigers . There is no way I can be in Detroit on the 26th. I’ve offered to buy a  Pride  ticket for friends (no takers unfortunately) if they’ll mail me the hat. Is there any way I can get one? Extras for sale in the D shop? #Pride

9669,When heterosexuals are persecuted and not allowed to get married and have to have rallies for basic rights and are murdered in some countries for their sexual orientation. Then you will get your heterosexual  pride .
9670,I’m just here for the idiotic comments questioning why there isn’t straight  pride  night lmfao
9671,Shoutout to the @tigers  @detroittigerspr  for keeping on this  Pride  Night despite all of the stupid homophobes being loud on the internet.  #yaaaaaaas  #motoron
9672,Exactly. All of the people saying “why isn’t there a game celebrating straight  pride ” obviously have never had to worry about who they’re dating. And they’ve probably never once even thought about what their lives would be like if they were gay.
9673,I see the @tigers  are having  Pride  Night on June 26. Is there a game that night? Watching the Tigers could possibly destroy everyone  pride .
9674,"The @tigers  are having a  Pride  Night next week. They’ve advertised it pretty well and true to form, the trolls and mongaloids are out to whine. 

Every single one of these Douche nozzle comments in their Instagram and other channels bring me so much pain and anger."
9675,"Because it’s  Pride  Month. It’s not like you have to participate. People celebrate things. Just move on, dude."
9676,Still 2 minutes of “promoting your sexuality” like y’all complain about. What u think the whole game is gonna be a gay orgy? They’ll prolly just give our  pride  themed hats and some ceremonies. Stop getting over yourself
9677,"The @tigers  are incredible for a lot of reasons. They’re doing something amazing for me, and I’m so thankful.

9689,Riveting. The same lineup that loses game after game. Spoiler Alert   that pathetic cash grab you call a  Pride  logo isn’t going to win anymore games.
